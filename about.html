    <h1>The Protest</h1>
    <p>Widespread protests erupted across Rajasthan, Delhi, and Haryana in late December 2025 against the Supreme Court’s acceptance of a new definition of the Aravalli Hills (restricting them to landforms above 100m elevation). Environmental groups, students, and local communities argued this would open vast stretches of the range to mining and urban encroachment,<br> threatening biodiversity and water security. The protests prompted the Supreme Court to pause its own ruling and announce a review.</p>
