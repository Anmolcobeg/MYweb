    <h1>What are the Aravalli Ranges?</h1>
    <p>The Aravalli Range (also spelled Aravali) is a mountain range in north-western India. running approximately 670 km (420 mi) in a south-west direction,<br> starting near Delhi, passing through southern Haryana and Rajasthan, and ending in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.<br> The highest peak is Guru Shikhar in Mount Abu, Rajasthan at 1,722 m (5,650 ft).<br> The Aravalli Range is the oldest fold-mountain belt in India, dating back to the Paleoproterozoic era.</p>
    <p>The Aravalli Hills is an ecologically sensitive zone that supports biodiversity, recharges groundwater,<br> and regulates climate across northern India – is at the centre of a legal and political storm after the government narrowed its definition.</p>

<h1>What functions does the Aravalli Range serve?</h1>
<p>The Aravalli Range serves several important functions:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Ecological Balance:</strong> The Aravalli Range is home to diverse flora and fauna, contributing to the ecological balance of the region.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate Regulation:</strong> The range helps in regulating the climate of the surrounding areas by acting as a barrier to the hot winds from the Thar Desert.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Recharge:</strong> The hills play a crucial role in recharging groundwater levels through natural springs and streams originating from the range.</li>
    <li><strong>Soil Conservation:</strong> The vegetation cover on the Aravalli Range helps in preventing soil erosion and maintaining soil fertility in the region.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> The Aravalli Range has historical and cultural significance, with several ancient temples and forts located in the region.</li>
</ol>
<h1>What are the challenges confronting the Aravalli Range?</h1>
<p>The Aravalli Range faces several challenges, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Illegal logging and deforestation for agriculture and urbanization have led to habitat loss and reduced biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Mining Activities:</strong> Unregulated mining for minerals has caused environmental degradation, including soil erosion and water pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Rapid urban development in the vicinity of the Aravalli Range has led to encroachment on protected areas and increased pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changes in climate patterns have affected the flora and fauna of the region, leading to shifts in ecosystems.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> There is a lack of public awareness about the importance of conserving the Aravalli Range, leading to insufficient conservation efforts.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Old Definition</h1>
<p> Earlier,The 2010 definition of the Aravalli hills was prepared by the Forest Survey of India after directions from the Supreme Court. Instead of using height as the main criterion, the survey relied on slope.<br> Any landform with a slope of at least three to four degrees was considered part of the Aravalli system.<br> This approach was chosen because the Aravallis are among the oldest mountain ranges in the world, deeply eroded and worn down over billions of years.<br> Many of their features are not tall peaks but low ridges, rocky outcrops, and undulating terrain that still function ecologically as hills. By using slope rather than height,<br> the 2010 definition included these smaller formations, ensuring that they were recognized as part of the range and protected from mining and deforestation.<br> This broader, more inclusive definition acknowledged the ecological importance of the Aravallis in preventing desertification, recharging groundwater, supporting biodiversity, and moderating the climate in northwestern India.</p>
<h1>The New Definition</h1>
<p>The new definition of the Aravalli Range, proposed in 2025, states that a hill must have a minimum height of 100 metres,<br> and the Aravalli system is defined as a cluster of two or more such hills located within 500 metres of each other. This was introduced to create a uniform legal standard across states for regulating mining and development.<br> However, in December 2025, the Supreme Court clarified and stayed this definition, noting that it could exclude vast stretches of the Aravalli terrain—especially low ridges and rocky outcrops—and thereby weaken ecological protection.<br> The Court emphasized that the Aravallis are critical for groundwater recharge, biodiversity, and preventing desertification, and warned that narrowing the definition could open sensitive areas to mining and urban expansion.<br> Thus, while the new definition sought uniformity, the Supreme Court’s clarification highlighted its ecological risks and kept the older, broader protections in place until further review</p>
<h1>The Real Problem With The New Definition</h1>
<p>The real problem with the new definition of the Aravalli Range lies in its potential to exclude significant portions of the terrain that are ecologically vital but do not meet the specified height criteria.<br> By setting a minimum height of 100 metres and requiring hills to be clustered within 500 metres, the new definition risks overlooking smaller ridges, rocky outcrops, and undulating terrains that play crucial roles in groundwater recharge, biodiversity support, and climate regulation.<br> This exclusion could lead to increased mining activities and urban development in these sensitive areas, resulting in habitat loss, soil erosion, and disruption of ecological balance.<br> Furthermore, the uniform legal standard may not adequately account for regional variations in topography and ecology, potentially undermining conservation efforts tailored to local needs.<br> Overall, the new definition could weaken protections for the Aravalli Range, threatening its environmental functions and the well-being of communities that depend on its resources.</p>
